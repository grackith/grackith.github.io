            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Pedestrian safety in urban environments remains a critical challenge, with U.S. cities experiencing a dramatic 60% increase in pedestrian fatalities over the past decade. To address this crisis, we're developing more sophisticated crash prediction models that incorporate detailed measures of pedestrian exposure to environmental risk. Our approach focuses on tracking pedestrian path-planning behaviors within microenvironments and analyzing their relationship to vehicle crash incidents at intersections. By incorporating granular data about pedestrian activity levels and environmental factors, we aim to create more accurate predictions of collision risk. The rarity of pedestrian-vehicle crashes, while fortunate, presents a significant challenge for developing preventative measures. Our research addresses this by establishing robust geospatial estimates of pedestrian activity as a proxy measure for crash likelihoodâ€”acknowledging that areas with higher pedestrian activity naturally face increased crash potential. Through this work, we're advancing both the performance of intersection-level crash predictions and developing a systematic framework for analyzing prediction model misclassifications, ultimately contributing to the design of safer urban spaces.</p>

          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Reinforcement learning methods have gained traction on the autonomous vehicle front for the ability to explore unknown state spaces and previously unseen environments. This adaptivity produces trained agents that can perform in real-world environments not exactly mimicking previous training environments. However, deploying these algorithms on-line in real-world traffic environments is still relatively nonexistant due to potential safety implications for both the in-vehicle driver and other road users (ORUs). Therefore, this project proposes a sim-to-sim transfer: previously trained human regularized RL agents (HR-PPO) are deployed into an multiplayer experimentation setting (Strangeland) to interact with driving and walking participants. This approach can validate and fine-tune RL agent training in a context-rich setting.</p>

        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This collaborative research between New York University and Technical University of Ingolstadt (THI) examines cultural influences on pedestrian behavior and regulatory compliance. With pedestrians constituting 23% of global road traffic fatalities in 2021, understanding cross-cultural behavioral patterns is critical for developing adaptive safety systems. Predicting pedestrian behavior remains challenging due to their dynamic movement patterns and variable adherence to traffic regulations.In addition, the development of autonomous vehicle systems face significant limitations in replicating human communication protocols that typically resolve ambiguous traffic situations. This is evidenced by incident data showing autonomous vehicle accidents predominantly occur during automated operation involving unexpected pedestrian actions. Through systematic analysis of pedestrian behavior at signalized intersections, this research aims to inform both the development of culturally-adaptive autonomous systems and the implementation of more effective urban infrastructure across diverse societal contexts.</p>

            <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: With over 42,000 roadway fatalities in 2022 and research showing that drivers spend roughly 50% of their time engaged in non-driving tasks, understanding driver behavior in complex environments is crucial. Our project leverages the largest naturalistic driving study to date (SHRP2 NDS) to examine how drivers multitask in multimodal urban environments. By analyzing 19 urban locations with pedestrian and cyclist infrastructure, we investigate driver engagement in secondary tasks while interacting with vulnerable road users.
Our analysis integrates three key data sources: video recordings of driver behavior and urban environments, vehicle kinematics (speed, acceleration), and anonymized demographic information. Using mixed-effect binary logistic regression and Bayesian network models, we identified significant patterns in driver behavior around crosswalks and bike treatments. The Bayesian networks, particularly valuable for modeling complex systems with uncertain relationships, reveal conditional dependencies between variables that could inform both infrastructure design and Advanced Driver Assist System (ADAS) development to enhance road safety for all users.</p>

A mixed logit model is developed to compare individual heterogeneity in soft, mass, and personal (vehicle) mode choices with local built environment support for observed choices. Sociodemographics such as age, income, and mobility status are also considered.

            <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: In this NSF-funded research project exploring the intersection of autonomous vehicles and mobile work environments, participants engage in a comprehensive experimental protocol that begins with informed consent and pre-experimental surveys, followed by essential training on the driving simulator. The study takes place in a simulated two-lane rural road environment where participants, initially driving manually, are instructed to activate conditional automation when comfortable and join a pre-recorded virtual meeting featuring three distinct voiceovers in a Wizard-of-Oz approach. During the meeting, which involves discussing and revising presentation slides, participants encounter a critical red-light running scenario where a lead vehicle obstructs their view of the violating vehicle, requiring them to take control of the vehicle under either Emergency or Planned conditions. The research aims to understand how meeting participation and engagement impact a driver's takeover timing in autonomous vehicles, while also examining the reciprocal effects of takeover scenarios on meeting performance, with participants completing a post-drive survey to capture their overall experience. This innovative study utilizes the NADS miniSim vehicle simulator to create a controlled environment for investigating the complex dynamics between virtual work engagement and autonomous vehicle safety protocols.</p>

            <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Older drivers face unique challenges that can contribute to age-related accidents, prompting our research into developing targeted sociodemographic profiles to enhance in-vehicle support systems. Building comprehensive naturalistic driving databases is both time-intensive and costly, which led us to explore an innovative approach: mapping driving profiles across different databases that share similar sociodemographic features but represent distinct populations. By bridging the <a href="https://insight.shrp2nds.us/">Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP2) naturalistic driving database</a> with the <a href="https://share-eric.eu/">Survey of Health, Aging, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE)</a>, we identify personal characteristics that allow us to examine how the choice to continue driving becomes a deeply contextual decision, shaped by one's cultural and geographic environment.</p>

              Measuring Pedestrian Exposure Using Electronic Devices

            <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Crashes involving pedestrians continue to be a serious problem in the United States and represent 15% of all traffic collisions. Pedestrians are among the most vulnerable road users. In 2020, pedestrians accounted for 6,516 fatalities and an estimated 54,769 injuries in motor vehicle crashes. Over the last decade, the U.S. has seen a 46% increase in pedestrian fatalities, now representing 17% of all motor vehicle related crash fatalities (NHTSA, 2022). In response to the increased number of fatalities and the increased emphasis on vulnerable road modes (walking, cycling) as healthy transportation options, many localities are looking for ways to make walking safer. One of the challenges to developing and implementing effective pedestrian safety countermeasures is establishing a consistent and reliable estimate of the number of pedestrians at risk in a given <em>spatiotemporal slice</em>. This project operationalizes a pedestrian exposure measure from personal electronic device data (GSP, accelerometer) collected at a weeks time from over 700 participants throughout a 4-year period.</p>
