          Hey! grace-io here. As a human-subjects researcher, I focus on developing human-like models that capture how road users behave in shared urban spaces. My dissertation work specifically explores how different cultures represent vulnerable road users in mixed-traffic environments. The goal is to create computational models that are <em>fair</em>, <em>safe</em>, and <em>robust</em> representations of real-time negotiations between motorized and nonmotorized road users, ultimately supporting the development of more equitable and inclusive transportation infrastructure, connected technologies, and automated systems in these complex urban environments.

        <p>Currently I'm a Transportation Systems Ph.D. Candidate at the <a href="https://c2smarter.engineering.nyu.edu/">C2SMART Institute</a> in the Civil & Urban Engineering Department at the New York University Tandon School of Engineering in Downtown Brooklyn, NY. My advisor is <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/linda-ng-boyle">Dr. Linda Ng Boyle</a> at C2SMART's HumanFUEL (Human Factors and Urban Ergonomics Lab), where we develop user-centered road safety solutions for a dynamic set of motorized and nonmotorized agents. Some current project work I am involved with:</p>

        <p><strong>Unregulated pedestrian behavior in mixed-traffic driving environments</strong>. Locale-specific feature learning is necessary training to ensure safe deployment around vulnerable road users. This project is jointly conducted at NYU and THI (Germany) to examine inter-cultural differences of pedestrian adherence to road regulation.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>How does vulnerable road user (VRU) behavior change between geographically separate locales?</li>
          <li>Are separate locales identifiable by their VRU behavior?</li>
          <li>How can locale-specific models of VRU behavior contribute to our current representations of mixed-traffic driving environments?</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Pedestrian exposure for crash prediction.</strong> Prediction models are only as good as the data they learn from. This study uses a previously developed pedestrian exposure to environmental risk measure to track microenvironment pedestrian path-planning and likelihood of vehicle crash incidence at the intersection-level of analysis.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>How does the inclusion of pedestrian activity in the microenvironment improve the performance of intersection-level crash rate prediction?</li>
          <li>How do we develop a framework for identifying, analyzing, and learning from prediction model misclassifications?</li>
        </ul>
